For every additional element, why you are adding it: adding a new server allowed us to add 
a load balancer to organize the traffic and we removed SPOF that we have one server only

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works: The round robin algorithm
connect in order unless a server is down. Requests are served sequentially

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
The load balancer work with active-active that both nodes are running at the same time. While active-passive not all node are active
at the same time if one is active the other is passive or standby

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works: master-slave enables data from one database server(master)
to other databases(slaves) where the master do all operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
while slaves read only the copies of the master

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application:
the main diffrence between them is their functionality and data consistency.
Primary node: Handles writes, ensures data authority, limited read access, single point of failure
Replica node: Handles reads, improves performance and availability, eventual consistency, read-only

Where are SPOF: the single point of fail is the load balancer

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS): that will lead to unsecured transportation between nodes

No monitoring: since there is no monitoring we can't istimate the downtime
