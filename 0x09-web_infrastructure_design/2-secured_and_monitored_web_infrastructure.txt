TASK 2
EXPLAIN
-------

For every additional element, why you are adding it:
1. we added fire walls to act as a gatekeeper that control the traffic that enter and leave my network it's important for my security
2. SSL certification(HTTPS) that secures the transportation of my data on the internet from attackers(hackers, viruses)
3. monitors that will collect logs and send it to our collector sumologic

What are firewalls for:
act as a gatekeeper that control the traffic that enter and leave my network it's important for my security
simply it makes barrier betwwen trusted network and the untrusted

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
HTTPS is secured where data is encrypted using transfer layer security(TLS)

What monitoring is used for:
it allows us to watch and detect any performance issue in our web application

How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
it collects logs of the application server, mySQL database and web server.
a log in computing context is the automaticlly produced and time-stamped documentation of events

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
one web server handles 1000 queries per second 

ISSUES
------

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:
1.the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is unencrypted
2.Web servers cannot directly see the original client IP address and other TLS handshake information
3.Setting up and managing SSL termination on the load balancer can be more complex than managing it directly on web servers

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
because once it's down that mean that the data is down also...that will leads to fail some features of the application

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem:
beacuse once there is a (bug, virus...) in one server it will get to the other
